# A nice looing resume
Nothing hurts me those days more than a CV that looks like an accident report. It is 2019, and no one should have an ugly CV. Therefore, I decided to create this react app of my resume, you can fill your data and photo and you get out-of-box nice looking CV.

# It is also responsive:

# PDF Or printed paper:
The CV will print nicely on paper or on pdf file:

## This is cool, but how I can fill my data?
### Developer?
Just clone this repo.
`npm install`
or
`yarn install`
edit the file `cv-content.json`, you can see where to fill, just replace the old data.
Once you are done, run:
`npm build`
or
`yarn build`

You will get the html version in the `build` folder.
Just upload it somewhere or you can even create a repo on github and upload it there. You can access the page using the GitHub.io domain.
Congratulations! you got a new cv.

### Not a Developer?
I'm still working on the simplest way possible where you can just run few commands and you get it right away. Right now, I can just ask you to be patient :).
