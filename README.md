# A nice looking resume
Nothing hurts me those days more than a CV that looks like an accident report. It is 2019, and no CV should be ugly. Therefore, I decided to create this react app of my resume, you can fill your data and photo and you get out-of-box nice looking CV.

# It is also responsive:

# PDF Or printed paper:
The CV will print nicely on a paper or even to pdf file in case you wanted a commonn format to be used in emails:

## This is cool, but how I can fill my data?
### Developer?

* Clone this repo.
* Install the depnedencies using NPM or Yarn.
* Edit the file `cv-content.json`, you can see where to fill, just replace the old data. 
* Build the app

#### Commands: 
```
npm install
// edit the json file.
npm build
```
Or using yarn:
```
yarn install
// edit the json file.
yarn build
```

You will get the html version in the `build` folder.<br/>
Just upload it somewhere or you can even create a repo on github and upload it there.<br/>
You can access the page using the GitHub.io domain.<br/>

Congratulations! you got a new cv.

### Not a Developer?
I'm still working on the simplest way possible where you can just run few commands and you get it right away. Right now, I can just ask you to be patient :).
